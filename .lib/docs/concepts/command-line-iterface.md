# Command Line Interface (`./bare`)

`bare` can be used in two ways:

1. directly on the command line (`./bare openai chat "Hello there"`)
2. via bare scripts (`openai chat "Hello there"`)

Essentially, when you interact with the bare commands via `bash` (command line), you must prepend it with `./bare`. If you are within the bare scope (inside a bare script), you may omit `./bare` if desired.
