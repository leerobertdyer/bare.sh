Playing Together.
Playing Beautifully.
The song is meant to be accompanied with the mbira (sometimes called thumb piano).
The mbira is an important part of Shona culture.
It is seen as a communication device to connect with ancestors and tribal guardians.
To imitate the mbira you may choose to “prepare” guitars by weaving a straightened paperclip between the strings.
Have students insert the paperclip at the sound hole and then slide it back toward the bridge.
If you choose to prepare the guitars, place this piece last in the program as tuning will be affected.
This arrangement follows that same concept, dividing the roles into three parts.
There are three sections in which guitar 1 begins with a simple repeating figure, followed by an offset part in guitar 2.
